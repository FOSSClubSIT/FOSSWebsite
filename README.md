# FOSS Club - Symbiosis Institute of Technology

Welcome to the **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Club** at **Symbiosis Institute of Technology**! We are an official student-led club focused on advocating for the use, development, and contribution to free and open source software. Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where students can learn, share, and contribute to the FOSS ecosystem.

## About FOSS

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) refers to software that is both free to use and modify, with its source code openly available to the public. The FOSS movement is built on values of collaboration, transparency, and shared knowledge, enabling a global community of developers to innovate and build together.

## Objectives of the FOSS Club

- **Promote awareness** of FOSS principles and practices among students.
- **Encourage contributions** to FOSS projects by providing mentorship and resources.
- **Host workshops, hackathons, and seminars** to equip students with the necessary skills to engage with FOSS.
- **Collaborate** with global open source projects and contribute meaningful changes.
- **Build a community** that supports and nurtures open-source development in Symbiosis Institute of Technology.

## Activities

- Regular **workshops** on Git, GitHub, and various FOSS tools.
- **Hackathons** to solve real-world problems using open source solutions.
- **Collaborative projects** where students can contribute to existing open source repositories.
- **Mentorship programs** to guide students in contributing to FOSS communities.
